<h1>Heschel Engineering Club</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Heschel Engineering Club's GitHub repository. Right now we are working with some <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a>s. Feel free to check out our Arduino "sketches".</p>
<p>If you create a sketch (and are a part of this club), feel free to add it to the repository for others to use for reference and/or admire your hard work. On that note, if you plan on adding a sketch, please make sure to add comments (using //... or /*... */) that explain each section of your code and what the purpose of every variable is (your variable names might be clear to you, but they definately won't be clear to everyone).</p>
<p>If you want "contributor" permissions, just email me.</p>
